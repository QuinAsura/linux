QTI's LAB (LCD/AMOLED BOOST)/IBB (Inverting Buck-Boost) Regulator

LAB can be used as a standalone positive boost power supply for general purpose
applications. IBB can be used as a standalone negative power supply for general
applications. Also, LAB and IBB can be used together to provide power supply for
display panels, LCD or AMOLED.

Main node required properties:

- compatible:			Must be "qcom,qpnp-labibb-regulator"

LAB subnode required properties:

- reg:				Specifies the SPMI address and size for this peripheral.
- reg-names:			Register names. Must be "lab".
- regulator-name:		A string used to describe the regulator.
- interrupts:				Specify the interrupts as per the interrupt
					encoding.
					Currently "lab-vreg-ok" is required and "lab-sc_err"
					is optional for LCD mode in pmi8998.
					For AMOLED mode, "lab-vreg-ok" is required
					only when SWIRE control is enabled and skipping
					2nd SWIRE pulse is required in pmi8952/8996.
- interrupt-names:			Interrupt names to match up 1-to-1 with
					the interrupts specified in 'interrupts'
					property.

IBB subnode required properties:

- reg:				Specifies the SPMI address and size for this peripheral.
- reg-names:			Register names. Must be "ibb".
- regulator-name:		A string used to describe the regulator.
- qcom,qpnp-ibb-init-voltage:	The default initial voltage when the bootloader does
				not turn on IBB regulator.

IBB subnode optional properties:

- interrupts:				Specify the interrupts as per the interrupt
					encoding.
					Currently "ibb-sc-err" could be used for LCD mode
					in pmi8998 to detect the short circuit fault.
- interrupt-names:			Interrupt names to match up 1-to-1 with
					the interrupts specified in 'interrupts'
					property.
- qcom,qpnp-ibb-lab-pwrup-delay:	Power up delay (in us) for IBB regulator when
					it is enabled or turned on. Supported values
					are 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000.
- qcom,qpnp-ibb-en-discharge:			A boolean property which upon set will
						enable discharge for IBB regulator.
						Otherwise, it is kept disabled.
Example:
	qcom,pmi8994@3 {
		qpnp-labibb-regulator {
			compatible = "qcom,qpnp-labibb-regulator";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;

			lab_regulator: qcom,lab@de00 {
				reg = <0xde00 0x100>;
				reg-names = "lab";

				interrupts = <0x3 0xde 0x0
						IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
                                interrupt-names = "lab-vreg-ok";

				regulator-name = "lab_reg";
				
			};

			ibb_regulator: qcom,ibb@dc00 {
				reg = <0xdc00 0x100>;
				reg-names = "ibb_reg";
				regulator-name = "ibb_reg";

				interrupt-names = "ibb-sc-err";
                                qcom,qpnp-ibb-init-voltage = <5500000>;
                                qcom,qpnp-ibb-lab-pwrup-delay = <8000>;
                                qcom,qpnp-ibb-en-discharge;
			};

		};
	};
