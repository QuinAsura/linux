Qualcomm SDM845 Network-On-Chip interconnect driver binding
-----------------------------------------------------------

SDM845 interconnect providers support system bandwidth requirements through
RPMh hardware accelerators known as Bus Clock Manager (BCM) and L3 bandwidth
requirements through Operation State Manager (OSM). The provider is able to
communicate with the BCM through the Resource State Coordinator (RSC) associated
with each execution environment. The RSC provider nodes must reside within an
RPMh device node pertaining to their RSC and each provider maps to a single RPMh
resource.

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
			"qcom,sdm845-rsc-hlos"
			"qcom,sdm845-osm-l3"

- clocks
	Usage:		required for "qcom,sdm845-osm-l3"
	Value type:	<phandle> From common clock binding.
	Definition:	clock handle for XO clock and GPLL0 clock.

- clock-names
	Usage:		required for "qcom,sdm845-osm-l3"
	Value type:	<string> From common clock binding.
	Definition:	must be "xo", "alternate".

- reg
	Usage:		required for "qcom,sdm845-osm-l3"
	Value type:	<prop-encoded-array>
	Definition:	Address and size of the OSM L3 memory base.

- #interconnect-cells : should contain 1

Examples:

apps_rsc: rsc {
	rsc_hlos: interconnect {
		compatible = "qcom,sdm845-rsc-hlos";
		#interconnect-cells = <1>;
	};
};

osm_l3: interconnect@17d41000 {
	compatible = "qcom,sdm845-osm-l3";
	reg = <0 0x17d41000 0 0x1400>;

	clocks = <&rpmhcc RPMH_CXO_CLK>, <&gcc GPLL0>;
	clock-names = "xo", "alternate";

	#interconnect-cells = <1>;
};
